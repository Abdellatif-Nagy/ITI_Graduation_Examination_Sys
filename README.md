# ITI_Graduation_Examination_Sys
The examination system is a streamlined method for performing examination-related tasks such as creating exam patterns with question banks, creating test timers, and administering exams digitally and without paper.
Our goal was to streamline the examination process for ITI staff by creating a user-friendly desktop application for conducting online exams and managing student data. Here's a breakdown of the functionalities we implemented:
•	SQL Database Design: We built a secure and scalable database using Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD) and implemented regular backups for data protection.
•	Automated Exam Management: Our team developed stored procedures to handle various functionalities, including generating exams, processing student answers, and correcting exams.
•	Comprehensive Reporting System: We created reports using stored procedures to provide ITI staff with valuable insights, such as student information by department, individual student grades, instructor course assignments, and detailed exam reports.
This project not only honed our technical skills in SQL database development, but also provided valuable experience in designing and implementing a real-world solution with practical applications for ITI.

We're all eager to leverage these experiences and our newly acquired skills in:
•	SSRS Reporting
•	Certificates and Professional Development
•	Freelancing and Contract Opportunities
•	Data Visualization with Power BI
•	Web Application Development (Bonus Skill)
